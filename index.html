		<h1>The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</h1>
		<h2>Section 7</h2>
		<p>I should have been a pair of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">ragged claws</a>
		<br>Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.
		<p>And the afternoon, the evening, <a href="http://www.paragonfineart.com/artists/vladimir-volegov.html">sleeps</a> so peacefully!
		<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu523TrIMpg">Smoothed by long fingers,
		<br>Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers</a>,
		<br>Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.
		<br>Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,
		<br>Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
		<br>But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
		<br>Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,
		<br>I am no prophet&mdash;and here's no great matter;
		<br>I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
		<br>And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
		<br>And in short, I was afraid.</p>
