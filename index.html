		<h1>The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</h1>
		<h2>Section 7</h2>
		<p>I should have been a pair of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">ragged claws</a>
			<br>Scuttling across the floors of <a href="silentSeas.html" target="_blank">silent seas</a>.</p>
		<p>And the afternoon, the evening, <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/a1/59/0b/a1590b29711dd76b188eb948fc4dc9ce.jpg" target="_blank">sleeps</a> so peacefully!
			<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu523TrIMpg" target="_blank">Smoothed by long fingers,
			<br>Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers</a>,
			<br>Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.
			<br>Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,
			<br>Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
			<br>But though I have wept and fasted, <a href="https://uploads8.wikiart.org/images/james-barry/king-lear-weeping-over-the-dead-body-of-cordelia-1788.jpg" target="_blank">wept and prayed</a>,
			<br>Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,
			<br>I am no prophet&mdash;and here's no great matter;
			<br>I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
			<br>And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
			<br>And in short, I was afraid.</p>
