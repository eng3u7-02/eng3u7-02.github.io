		<h1>The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</h1>
		<h2 id="Platter">Platter</h2>
		<p><b>Line:</b><i> Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter, 
			I am no prophet—and here's no great matter</i></p>
		<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%206:14-29" target="_blank">John the Baptist Beheaded</a></p>
		<h3>Rationale:</h3>
		<p>This line of the poem is an allusion to a Bible verse, describing the beheading of John the Baptist, who was said to be a prophet. In 
		<br>summary, John misspoke against the new wife of King Herod, Herodias, by telling King Herod that it is improper to take in his brother’s 
		<br>wife. This lead Herodias to hold a grudge against John and she wanted to kill him. An opportunity came when King Herod held a banquet on 
		<br>his birthday, in which his step-daughter Salome danced for him. He promised her she could have anything she wanted, up to half his kingdom, 
		<br>and Salome asked for John the Baptist’s head on a platter, of which she presented to her mother Herodias. The speaker of the poem claims 
		<br>to also have seen  his head on a platter, but because he is not a prophet, he believes his situation is less important and of “no great 
		<br>matter”, emphasizing his sense of inferiority.</p>
		
		<h2 id="Flicker">Flicker</h2>
		<p><b>Line:</b><i> I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker</i></p>
		<p>Darkness and devils!
		<br>Saddle my horses; call my train together:
		<br>Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee.
		<br>Yet have I left a daughter.
		<br>- Act I, Scene iv, King Lear, King Lear</p>
		<h3>Rationale:</h3>
		<p>This short excerpt from Shakespeare’s King Lear, Act I Scene iv, is spoken by King Lear himself right after he was denied by his daughter 
		<br>Goneril to stay at her residence. Although it is not said how, the speaker says he has seen “the moment of his greatness flicker”. 
		<br>Paralleling that, Lear’s authority as a king appears to be stripped away by a daughter who he gave half his land and power to, and his 
		<br>authority dims. In a fit of rage, Lear storms out of Goneril’s residence, reminding himself that he has another daughter. This gives him 
		<br>the sense that his authority, as a father and as a king, has returned. As a result, this short passage demonstrates how Lear’s “greatness”, 
		<br>his power and authority, is shown to “flicker”, just as how the speaker’s moment of greatness was said to have flickered.</p>
