		<br>Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee.
		<br>Yet have I left a daughter.
		<br>- Act I, Scene iv, King Lear, King Lear</p>
		<p>This short excerpt from Shakespeare’s King Lear, Act I Scene iv, is spoken by King Lear himself right after he was denied by his daughter 
		<br>Goneril to stay at her residence. Although it is not said how, the speaker says he has seen “the moment of his greatness flicker”. 
		<br>Paralleling that, Lear’s authority as a king appears to be stripped away by a daughter who he gave half his land and power to, and his 
		<br>authority dims. In a fit of rage, Lear storms out of Goneril’s residence, reminding himself that he has another daughter. This gives him 
		<br>the sense that his authority, as a father and as a king, has returned. As a result, this short passage demonstrates how Lear’s “greatness”, 
		<br>his power and authority, is shown to “flicker”, just as how the speaker’s moment of greatness was said to have flickered.</p>
		<p>(this will be the rationale)</p>
