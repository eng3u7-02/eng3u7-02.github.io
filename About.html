                <p style="color:#FFA726;"><b>Hello!</b> I am Carlen, the maker of this website. Here you will find (hopefully interesting) links to other sites, 
                <br>pictures, videos and texts all of which are dedicated to helping you understand this modernist poem!
                <br>I hope you enjoy your stay!
		<p style="color:#FFA726;">Carlen loves to learn, read, and make jokes about IB. When time permits, Carlen reminisces about the past,
		<br>where the fond memories of previous school years come to mind. Outside of school, Carlen can be found playing 
		<br>musical instruments, attending archery club, and volunteering at a senior home.
