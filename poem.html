		<h1 style="color:#FFFFFF;">The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</h1>
		<h2 style="color:#FFFFFF;">Ragged Claws</h2>
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Silent woods <br>Lonely trees <br>No one around—no one next to me <br>Little boy <br>Warm summer breeze 
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">When he saw me <br>he loudly screamed <br>Discontent <br>Anger <br>Deep envy
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">There and then <br>My rough hands <br>Found their place <br>Around his neck 
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">The earth accepted him <br>The wind tucked him in <br>The world had one less boy <br>To hate a monster like me  
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">I would never be <br>Any less monstrous than he 
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Little Frankenstein <br>Why do you upset me? <br>Could you not have <br>Held that last scream?
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Innocent angel <br>Your glorious features <br>Defy my existence <br>If you are diamond <br>Then I am coal
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Wherever I go <br>They make me to be less <br>Of a human than they 
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Should I be the only <br>Deprived of attributes that<br>Make you beautiful<br>And lack thereof <br>Make me beastly? 
		<h3 style="color:#FFFFFF;">Rationale:</h3>
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">(insert rationale here)</p>
		<h2 style="color:#FFFFFF;">Afraid</h2>
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">What is it I seek on this path alone,<br>When I cannot feel this body I call my own?<br>From a distance, I spot a tall stranger<br>Suddenly, I feel a sense of danger</p>
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Straight up ahead there is such darkness,<br>As if there was no light to harness.<br>Yet towards the darkness I am drawn,<br>And I see I am nothing but a pawn.</p>
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">The stranger! I remember as I look around,<br>But he is nowhere to be found.<br>My eyes wander for anything I can find,<br>And then I feel a shiver up my spine.</p>
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">I look ahead, and again there he is,<br>Staring at me with hollow eyes of his.<br>Through the darkness, I find him in the centre,<br>Beckoning me, with his hand, to enter.</p>
		<h3 style="color:#FFFFFF;">Rationale:</h3>
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">The poem “Afraid” represents the fear of death of the speaker from “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock”, who claims to have seen the “eternal Footman”, the Grim Reaper. Aside from the fear of death, this poem also portrays the fear of the unknown and the unwillingness to take risks. The speaker appears lost after death, wandering with no goal in mind, and eventually finding a path to the darkness and the unknown. The tall stranger spotted by the speaker is the representation of the “eternal Footman” who has come to take the unwilling speaker to the afterlife, as daunting as death may be.</p>
