		<h1 style="color:#FFFFFF;">The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</h1>
		<h2 style="color:#FFFFFF;">Ragged Claws</h2>
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Silent woods <br>Lonely trees <br>No one aroundâ€”no one next to me <br>Little boy <br>Warm summer breeze 
			<br>When he saw me <br>he loudly screamed <br>There and then <br>My rough hands <br>Found its place <br>Around his neck 
			<br>The world had one less boy <br>To hate a monster like me <br>And there he lay <br>An innocent angel <br>Beneath the stars
			<br>I would never be <br>Any less monstrous than he <br>Why must I carry out revenge <br>When they make me to be less 
			<br>Of a human than they <br>They how have glorious features <br>While I bask in my ugly appearance <br>In vain?

		<h2 style="color:#FFFFFF;">Afraid</h2>
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">What is it I seek on this path alone,<br>When I cannot feel this body I call my own?<br>From a distance, I spot a tall stranger<br>Suddenly, I feel a sense of danger</p>
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Straight up ahead there is such darkness,<br>As if there was no light to harness.<br>Yet towards the darkness I am drawn,<br>And I see I am nothing but a pawn.</p>
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">The stranger! I remember as I look around,<br>But he is nowhere to be found.<br>My eyes wander for anything I can find,<br>And then I feel a shiver up my spine.</p>
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">I look ahead, and again there he is,<br>Staring at me with hollow eyes of his.<br>Through the darkness, I find him in the centre,<br>Beckoning me, with his hand, to enter.</p>
