		<h1 style="color:#FFFFFF;">The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</h1>
		<h2 style="color:#FFFFFF;">Ragged Claws</h2>
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">By Helen Du</p>
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Silent woods <br>Lonely trees <br>No one around <br>No one next to me 
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Little boy <br>Cool summer breeze <br>When he saw me <br>He screamed 
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Discontent <br>Anger <br>Deep envy
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">There and then <br>My rough hands <br>Found their place <br>Around his neck 
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">The earth accepted him <br>The wind tucked him in <br>The world had one less boy <br>To hate a monster like me  
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">I would never be <br>Any less monstrous than he 
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Little Frankenstein <br>Why do you upset me? <br>Could you have not<br>Held in that last scream?
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Innocent angel <br>Your glorious features <br>Defy my existence <br>If you are diamond <br>Then I am coal
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Wherever I go <br>They make me to be less <br>Of a human than they are
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Should I be the only <br>Deprived of attributes that<br>Make you beautiful<br>And lack thereof <br>Make me beastly? 
		<h3 style="color:#FFFFFF;">Rationale:</h3>
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">The poem “Ragged Claws” tells of the murder of William Frankenstein from the monster’s perspective. It is meant to represent 
					<br>the lack of self worth that both J. Alfred Prufrock and the monster have. The word “coal” in the line “Then I am coal” highlights
					<br> a lack of self worth, as coal is a resource that is less valued than “diamond” (from the previous line). Both section 7 and the 
					<br>poem describe the individuals as  “ragged claws” and “coal” (respectively)—nothing of particular significance or aesthetic beauty. 
					<br>As Prufrock continues to ponder his insignificance and what will become of his existence, so too does the monster reflect on his 
					<br>place in Frankenstein’s world.</p>
		<h2 style="color:#FFFFFF;">Afraid</h2>
		<h3 style="color:#FFFFFF;">By Carrie Men</h3>
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">What is it I seek on this path alone,<br>When I cannot feel this body I call my own?<br>From a distance, I spot a tall stranger<br>Suddenly, I feel a sense of danger</p>
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">Straight up ahead there is such darkness,<br>As if there was no light to harness.<br>Yet towards the darkness I am drawn,<br>And I see I am nothing but a pawn.</p>
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">The stranger! I remember as I look around,<br>But he is nowhere to be found.<br>My eyes wander for anything I can find,<br>And then I feel a shiver up my spine.</p>
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">I look ahead, and again there he is,<br>Staring at me with hollow eyes of his.<br>Through the darkness, I find him in the centre,<br>Beckoning me, with his hand, to enter.</p>
		<h3 style="color:#FFFFFF;">Rationale:</h3>
		<p style="color:#FFFFFF;">The poem “Afraid” represents the fear of death of the speaker from “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock”, who claims to have 
					<br>seen the “eternal Footman”, the Grim Reaper. Aside from the fear of death, this poem also portrays the fear of the unknown and 
					<br>the unwillingness to take risks. The speaker appears lost after death, wandering with no goal in mind, and eventually finding 
					<br>a path to the darkness and the unknown. The tall stranger spotted by the speaker is the representation of the “eternal Footman” 
					<br>who has come to take the unwilling speaker to the afterlife, as daunting as death may be.</p>
