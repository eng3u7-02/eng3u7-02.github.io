		<h3 style="color:#FFFFFF;">Rationale:</h3>
		<p style="color: #FFFFFF;">The above video taken from the movie Edward Scissorhands is a scene in which Edward meets a girl named Kim, for the first time. The words 
					<br>“long fingers” is similar to the long finger-like project seen on both of Edward’s hands. The line “Asleep … tired … or it malingers,” is 
					<br>portrayed with Edward lying on Kim’s bed, appearing to sleep, but not sleeping at all. Kim’s unawareness of Edward’s presence is symbolic 
					<br>of the next line “Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me,”, because though Edward is so spatially close to her, she is unaware 
					<br>of it until later on. The speaker seems to imply that there are unknown dangers that lurk about unbeknownst to us, since “long fingers”
					<br>are associated with evil beings like Witches. “Asleep … tired … or it malingers,” implies that whatever is lurking about may be of 
					<br>vicious intent, as nobody knows what it is doing.</p>
		<h2 id="Alice">Alice in Wonderland: Tea Party</h2>

		<h3 style="color: #FFFFFF">Rationale</h3>
		<p style="color: #FFFFFF">This video is a scene taken from the movie Alice in wonderland, in which the Mad Hatter is throwing a tea party. This correlates to the line 
					<br>where the speaker describes a tea party-like setting and then proceeds to ask if he should stir up trouble after having nourishment to satisfy 
					<br>his hunger. Here, the Mad Hatter is having tea and cakes, like described in the poem. After meeting Alice, he gets agitated when discussing 
					<br>the event that have caused Wonderland to fall into the wrong hands, and shouts at the Cheshire Cat. The Mad Hatter shouting at the Cheshire 
					<br>Cat is an example of a conflict that could have been avoided if he managed to keep his temper at bay. In our section of the poem by T. S. Eliot, 
					<br>the speaker appears to be saying that it is irrational to waste his energy on starting conflicts (in which he cannot win) when his hunger is 
					<br>satiated by the food he has consumed. In the next line, the speaker seems to be offering an alternative to nourishment: if in periods of 
					<br>abundance there is conflict, then perhaps prayer and fasting (scarcity) would be effective in ridding of conflicts.</p>
