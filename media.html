		<h2 id="Seas">Silent Seas</h2>
		<p><b>Line:</b><i> I should have been a pair of ragged claws/Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.</i></p>
		<p>(Original Art by Carrie Men)<br><img src="silentSeas.jpg" width="750" height="500"/></p>
		<p>Rationale:</p>
		<p>This particular piece of artwork was chosen because it represents the self-deprecation of the speaker found in these 
		<br>two lines. As shown, a figure sits at the bottom of the sea at the same level as sea creatures who “scuttle across 
		<br>the floors”. The figure is looking down and pondering, while giving off the feeling of being inferior and hopeless. 
		<br>In addition, the white circle around the figure contrasting the dark background colour demonstrates the solitude of 
		<br>the figure, and how they keep to themselves much more often. The dark background itself represents the unknown 
		<br>and darkness in the figure’s surroundings, meanwhile emphasizing the speaker’s feeling of regret and belittlement.</p>
