		<h1>The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</h1>
		<p><a href="index.html">Back to Home</a></p>
		<h2 id="Seas" namea="Seas">Silent Seas</h2>
		<p><b>Line:</b><i> I should have been a pair of ragged claws/Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.</i></p>
		<p>(Original Art by Carrie Men)<br><img src="silentSeas.jpg" width="750" height="500"/></p>
		<h3>Rationale:</h3>
		<p>This particular piece of artwork was chosen because it represents the self-deprecation of the speaker found in these 
		<br>two lines. As shown, a figure sits at the bottom of the sea at the same level as sea creatures who “scuttle across 
		<br>the floors”. The figure is looking down and pondering, while giving off the feeling of being inferior and hopeless. 
		<br>In addition, the white circle around the figure contrasting the dark background colour demonstrates the solitude of 
		<br>the figure, and how they keep to themselves much more often. The dark background itself represents the unknown 
		<br>and darkness in the figure’s surroundings, meanwhile emphasizing the speaker’s feeling of regret and belittlement.</p>

		<h2 id="Sleeps" name="Sleeps">Sleeps so Peacefully</h2>
		<p><b>Line:</b><i> And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!</i></p>
		<p><img src="peacesleep.png" width="750" height="500"/><p>
		<h3>Rationale:</h3>
		<p>The sleeping girl pictured above is a visual depiction of tranquil rest, with the flowers surrounding her to 
		<br>denote a restfulness that is found in nature. The line in section 7: “And the Afternoon, the evening, sleeps 
		<br>so peacefully!” personifies how times of the day pass by with ease, and seem unaffected by events, just as one 
		<br>cannot be easily awaken from deep sleep. What J. Alfred Prufrock appears to be saying is that the simple things 
		<br>in life (such as rest) derived from simply existing are not cherished, until they are taken away. There are many 
		<br>thoughts and ideas (dreams) surrounding the sleeping girl which reflect a sense of tranquility of the inner mind, 
		<br>and detachment from reality. The balance of colours and visual aspects induces a calming effect in the overall piece.</p>

		<h2 id="Wept" name="Wept">Wept and Prayed</h2>
		<p><b>Line:</b><i> But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed</i></p>
		<p><img src="wept.jpg" width="750" height="500"/></p>
		<h3>Rationale:</h3>
		<p>In this picture shown, King Lear grieves over the death of his daughter Cordelia. In the play, Lear is shown to have
		<br>wept and mourned over her death, hoping to believe it isn’t true and praying that she may still be alive. In the poem, 
		<br>the speaker is shown to have “wept and prayed” but then says that he is “no prophet–and here’s no great matter” as if 
		<br>to imply the futility of his efforts spent on weeping and praying, saying they were unimportant. Similarly, King Lear’s 
		<br>futile efforts in mourning over his dearest daughter’s death are in vain as it is impossible to bring her back to life.</p>

		<h2 id="Footman" name="Footman">Eternal Footman</h2>
		<p><b>Line:</b><i> And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker.</i><p>
		<p>(Original Art by Helen Du)<br><img src="grimReaper.jpg" width="750" height="500"/></p>
		<h3>Rationale:</h3>
		<p>The above sketch depicts the grim reaper opening the door to a seemingly never ending staircase to a soul who is 
		<br>reluctant to enter. The soul is a representation of Prufrock himself, as he is fearful of the what is to come in 
		<br>the future (the world beyond the door), because it is uncertain (just like how each step of the staircase is 
		<br>darker as one descends). Prufrock’s fear, and the Eternal Footman’s snicker were illustrated on both faces of 
		<br>the soul and Grim Reaper (respectively). In addition, the grim reaper represents the “eternal footman” that 
		<br>Prufrock mentions. A footman’s job is to hold doors for people and take off their coats, which is why a coat 
		<br>was drawn, housing a top hat and coat. However, because the grim reaper is an “eternal footman” the guests he 
		<br>houses are meant to stay forever. This is indicated by the tag on the soul’s foot, as the dead are tagged, 
		<br>showing that once the soul enters eternity, there is no return to a mortal state of being. As well, the coat 
		<br>and hat on the rack belongs to a guest that has come before the soul, indicating that the previous guest has 
		<br>not left the grim reaper’s dwelling. The coat rack is also embellished with a pitch fork’s end to symbolize 
		<br>that the soul is about to enter eternity in a hellish place.</p>
